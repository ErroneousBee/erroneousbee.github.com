<TITLE>Upgrade Notes for Wife 1.0</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

Last year a friend of mine upgraded GirlFriend 6.0 to Wife 1.0 and
found that it's a memory hog leaving very little system resources for
other applications.  He is only now noticing that Wife 1.0 also is
spawning Child-Processes which are further consuming valuable resources.<P>

No mention of this particular phenomena was included in the product
brochure or the documentation, though other users have informed him that
this is to be expected due to the nature of the application.  Not only
that, Wife 1.0 installs itself such that it is always launched at system
initialization where it can monitor all other system activity.  He's
finding that some applications such as PokerNight 10.3, BeerBash 2.5,
and PubNight 7.0 are no longer able to run, crashing the system when
selected  (even though they always worked fine before).  At
installation, Wife 1.0 automatically installs undesired plug-ins such as
MotherInLaw 55.8 and BrotherInLaw Beta release.  As a consequence system
performance seems to diminish with each passing day.<P>

Some features he'd like to see in the upcoming Wife 2.0:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>A "Don't remind me again" button
<LI>A minimize button
<LI>An install shield feature that allows Wife 2.0 to be installed
with the option to uninstall at anytime without the loss of cache and
other system resources.
<LI>An option to run the network driver in promiscuous mode which
would allow the systems hardware probe feature to have greater use.
</UL>
<P>

  I myself decided to avoid all of the headaches associated with Wife
1.0 by sticking with GirlFriend 2.0.  Even here, however, I found many
problems.  Apparently you cannot install Girlfriend 2.0 on top of
GirlFriend 1.0. You must uninstall GirlFriend 1.0 first.  Other users
say this is a long standing bug which I should have been aware of.
Apparently the versions of GirlFriend have conflicts over shared use by
the I/O port.  You think they would have fixed such a stupid bug by now.<P>

  To make matters worse, the uninstall program for GirlFriend 1.0
doesn't work  very well leaving traces of the application in the system.<P>

  Another annoying problem - all versions of GirlFriend continually
popup annoying messages about the advantages of upgrading to Wife 1.0.<P>

<H2>***** BUG WARNING *****</H2>
  Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug.  If you try to install Mistress 1.1
 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files
 before executing a self-uninstallation.  Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse
 to install, claiming insufficient system resources.<P>

<H2>***** BUG WORK-AROUNDS *****</H2>
   To avoid the above bug, try installing Mistress 1.1 on a different
 system and  never run any file transfer applications such as LapLink
 6.0. Also, beware of similar shareware applications that have been known
 to carry viruses that may affect Wife 1.0. Another solution would be to
 run Mistress 1.1 via a UseNet provider under an anonymous name.  Here
 again, beware of the viruses which can accidentally be downloaded from
 the UseNet.<P>
