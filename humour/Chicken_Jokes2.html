How Did The Chicken Cross the Road?</H1>
<B>NT Chicken</B>
<BR>Will cross the road in June; no, in August. September for sure.

<P><B>OS/2 Chicken</B>
<BR>It tried to cross the road several times, and finally gave up.

<P><B>Win 95 Chicken</B>
<BR>You see different coloured feathers while it crosses, but cook it and
it still tastes like ... chicken.

<P><B>Microsoft Chicken (tm)</B>
<BR>It's already on both sides of the road. And it just bought the road.

<P><B>Unix Chicken</B>
<BR>There's no real reason to cross the road. Just make a symbolic link
to anywhere you want the chicken to be.

<P><B>OOP Chicken</B>
<BR>It doesn't need to cross the road, it just sends a message.

<P><B>Assembler Chicken</B>
<BR>First it builds the road ...

<P><B>C Chicken</B>
<BR>It crosses the road without looking both ways.

<P><B>C++ Chicken</B>
<BR>The chicken wouldn't have to cross the road, you'd simply refer to
him on the other side.

<P><B>VB Chicken</B>
<BR>USHighways!TheRoad cross (aChicken)

<P><B>Delphi Chicken</B>
<BR>The chicken is dragged across the road and dropped on the other side.

<P><B>Java Chicken</B>
<BR>If your road needs to be crossed by a chicken, the server will download
a chicklet to the other side.

<P><B>Web Chicken</B>
<BR>Jumps out onto the road, turns right, and just keeps on running.

<P><B>Gopher Chicken</B>
<BR>Tried to cross, but got flattened by the Web chicken.

<P><B>Apple Newton Chicken</B>
<BR>Can't cluck, can't fly, and can't lay eggs, but you can carry it across
the road in your pocket.

<P><B>Cray Chicken</B>
<BR>Crosses faster than any other chicken, but if you don't dip it in liquid
nitrogen first, it arrives on the other side fully cooked.

<P><B>Quantum Logic Chicken</B>
<BR>The chicken is distributed probabilistically on all sides of
the road until you observe it on the side of your choice.

<P><B>Lotus Chicken</B>
<BR>Don't you dare try to cross the road the same way we do!

<P><B>Mac Chicken</B>
<BR>No reasonable chicken owner would want a chicken to cross the road,
so there's no way to tell it to.
