KOROLYOV, RUSSIA. - Russian and U.S. scientists are increasingly excited
about the Mir space station project, which promises to reveal more than
has ever been known about the scientific relationship between weightlessness
and mortal terror.<BR>
<BR>
"By stranding our scientists on a dilapidated space station with faulty
wiring, loose hardware, and malfunctioning air systems," NASA head Daniel
Goldin said, "we have created extremely favorable conditions for learning
about spaceborne panic."&nbsp; The two Russians and one American on board
the station are reportedly terrified beyond lucidity.<BR>
<BR>
Among the groundbreaking experiments conducted on board Mir: a June 25
collision with a cargo craft that depressurized the Spektr module; last
week's emergency power shortage, caused by a disconnected cable; and the
periodic release of "dry ice" steam that simulates a shipboard fire. All
have been deemed a huge success by agency heads.<BR>
<BR>
"They are in a constant state of being frightened for their very lives",
Russian mission director Vladimir Solovyov said. "And we have not even
used the hull-mounted Alien puppet that taps on the window yet."
<BR><BR>
We have also taken huge leaps in our understanding of the patterns created
when one wets his pants in the weightlessness of space," Solovyov said.
"The urine spreads out in an expanding sphere, something we did not expect."<BR>
<BR>
Taking a break from his busy schedule, astronaut Michael Foale told ABC
News reporters: "Where is Mommy?"<BR>
<BR>
"Please tell me the access code to the Soyuz capsule," Russian cosmonaut
Aleksandr Lazutkin said. "I would like to return to the chaotic government
and widespread hunger of my homeland."<BR>
<BR>
Scientists expect to gain even more useful data during an experiment at
3 a.m. tomorrow. As the astronauts sleep, whirling red siren lights will
flood the cabin while an ear-splitting klaxon alarm jolts them awake. Detailed
scientific data will then be collected on such variables as open weeping
and hair loss.
