<LI>1950, the old math...
<BR>

<P>


<LI>1960, the old math wanes...
<BR>
 A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.  His cost of
 production is four-fifths of the price, or $80.  What is his
 profit?
<P>


<LI>1970, the new math...
<BR>
 A logger exhanges a set "L" of lumber for a set "M" of money.
 The cardinality of set "M" is 100, and each element is worth
 $1.  Make 100 dots representing the elements of the set "M".
 The set "C" of the costs of production contains 20 fewer points
 than set "M".  Represent the set "C" as a subset of "M", and
 answer the following question:  What is the cardinality of the
 set "P" of profits?
<P>


<LI>1980, leveling the playing field...
<BR>
 A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.  His cost of
 production is $80, and his profit is $20.  Your assignment:

<P>


<LI>1990, outcome-based education...
<BR>
 By cutting down beautiful forest trees, a logger makes $20.
 What do you think of the this way of making a living?  (Topic

 feel?)
<P>


<LI>1997, profit-driven education...
<BR>
 By laying off %40 of the its loggers, a company improves its stock

 investment.
