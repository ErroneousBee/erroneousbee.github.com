[poster1]: spirimawgus_workshop_01.png "Morris Dancing Poster"

All of my professional work is for intranets, and I do not have copyright to rehost it. So here are a few snippets by way of a portfolio:

A simple [orbital period calculator](deltapavonis.html).

A [pie menu](piemenu/piemenu_click.html) in JavaScript, click to open, move mouse to select, click to activate selection.

A [pie menu](piemenu/piemenu_move.html) in JavaScript. In this version: click, hold mouse down, drag to select, release to activate selection. (under development)

A frames based [reaction game](reactiongame/index.html) I created years ago to test inter-frame communication.
